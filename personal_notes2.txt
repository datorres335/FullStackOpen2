PART 1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//If you clone a project, run the "npm install" command before starting the application with "npm start" or "npm run dev"

npm create vite@latest folder-name -- --template react


PART 2 - Communicating with server -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
npx json-server --port 3001 db.json //need to create "db.json" in root dir before running this command
		//NOTE: it is a "NPX" command not "NPM"
npm install axios // always run npm commands in the project root directory (where the package.json file is found); 
		// axios = promises = asynchronous operations //often used with useEffects -> useEffect(execute this, when this changes)
npm install json-server --save-dev //must make a small addition to the scripts part in the package.json file-> "server": "json-server -p 3001 db.json"
		// --save-dev means to install as a devDependency
npm run server //starts the json server. Note: all custom scripts must include "run" (exceptions are the start and test scripts)


PART 3 - Programming a server with NodeJS and Express ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
npm init //initializes a new Node.js project by creating a package.json file. No other files are created
npm index.js or npm start // create a .js file in the root of the project and add this code to the "script" section in the package.json file as 		//"start": "node index.js". You can replace "start" and "index" with what ever words you like. This is to start the Node server
		// npm start is a custom script that we defined in index.js
npm install express //express is used to help facilitate Node's code to create backend servers
npm update //updates the dependencies of the project
npm install //used when working on the same project but on another computer in order to install up-to-date dependencies. Must be ran in the project's 		root directory
		//running this command will create the "node_modules" directory. Make sure to add this directory to your .gitignore file. You include 		in your file by simply writing "node_modules" in the file (without the quotation marks). You only have to worry about doing when 		creating backend servers with "npm init" and not the front end server with "npm create vite@latest..."
node --watch index.js /* used to automatically restart the backend server when the code changes (must still refresh the browser manually tho). 
		//Add this code to the "script" section in the package.json file as "dev": "node --watch index.js" */
npm run dev //to start your project server in development mode (once you add the above script in the package.json file)
		//Note: that this "npm run dev" in this project is different to "npm run dev" in Parts 1 and 2 where we created the project with
		//"npm create vite@latest"
		//Note: all custom scripts must include "run"

Postman plugin or https://www.postman.com/downloads/  /*you can install Postman VSCode plug-in or download locally, useful for testing backend code*/
		//to make POST requests, you must click on the Body tab > "raw" radio button > set dropdown box to JSON
			> provide a js object in the text box below
		//Note: keys in the js object must be strings (in double quotes)
REST Client VSCode plugin //alternative tool to postman plugin, visit https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3/node_js_and_express for instructions
		//create "requests" directory at root of app > create "get_all_<NAME>.rest" > define request: GET http://localhost:3001/api/notes
			> click on "Send Request"
		//creating a POST request file is a bit more complicated than a GET request file, look up on how to define a POST request file
		//benefit of using REST Client over Postman is that everyone in the development team has access to these file
		//you can also define multiple requests by separating them with "###"
		//NOTE: empty lines in .rest files are NOT ignored when you send the request. As such they can create problems and should avoid using 
			unnecessary empty lines 

npm install morgan //The morgan middleware is a popular HTTP request logger for Node.js and Express applications. When you install it with npm install 		morgan, you can use it to automatically log details about every HTTP request your server receives. It’s especially useful during 		development, debugging, and troubleshooting.
		//NOTE: DON'T USE MORGAN ON YOUR DEPLOYED PROJECT! Logging data can contain sensitive info and can violate privacy law

npm install cors /* install this in your backend repository. This allows your server to accept requests from web pages that are hosted on a different 		domain, protocol, or port than your backend. Implement the cors middleware near the top of index.js */
npm remove cors //used when you don't need cors middleware anymore
		//you can remove the cors middleware after you set up a proxy in the front end in the vite.config.js file

npm run build /* vite command used to create a production build optimized for production, run the command at the root of the FRONTEND directory, then 		you need to copy the newly generated directory "dist" into the root of your BACKEND directory (you can use the command "cp -r 			dist ../../part3" for quick copying) */
//in the backend package.json file include these custom scripts to quickly update the frontend code in dist located in the backend
"build:ui": "rm -rf dist && cd ../frontend && npm run build && cp -r dist ../backend",
"deploy:full": "npm run build:ui && git add . && git commit -m uibuild && git push"
		// modify script relative paths as needed
		// npm run build:ui
		// npm run deploy:full
		// On Windows, npm scripts are executed in cmd.exe as the default shell which does not support bash commands. For the above bash 		commands to work, you can change the default shell to Bash (in the default Git for Windows installation) as follows:
			npm config set script-shell "C:\\Program Files\\git\\bin\\bash.exe"

node --inspect index.js //used to debug your code in the Chrome dev console, you'll need to click on the green node logo that appears in the console

npm install mongoose //using mongoose API instead of MongoDB directly, install this in the backend directory
node mongo.js yourPassword //used to test the temporary MongoDB file created to test our database, replace "yourPassword" with the password you created 		for the database USER you created (not the MongoDB Atlas account password you created). Refer to your mongo.js file to see how this 		file works when you run it in the terminal

npm install dotenv //a more sophisticated way to define environment variables. Need to create a ".env" file at the root of the project to create these 		environment vars

npm run build:ui // custom script, must be inside of the working directory where the package.json file is located, MUST RUN IN GIT BASH TERMINAL?
npm run deploy:full // custom script, must be inside of the working directory where the package.json file is located, MUST RUN IN GIT BASH TERMINAL?

npm install eslint @eslint/js --save-dev // tool used to check for errors in javascript while in development mode
		//install this in the backend
npx eslint --init // needed to initialize the eslint tool, choose these answers: 
		//How would you like to use ESLint? syntax 
		//What type of modules does your project use? commonjs 
		//Which framework does your project use? none 
		//Does your project use TypeScript? javascript
		//Where does your code run? node
		//Would you like to install them now? yes 
		//Which package manager do you want to use? npm 
			//Configuration will then be saved at "eslint.config.mjs". Refer to part3/eslint.config.mjs on how to reformat the file
npm install --save-dev @stylistic/eslint-plugin-js // a plugin that defines a set of code style-related rules
npx eslint index.js // inspects and validates a file like index.js
npm run lint // custom script, refer to part3/package.json for implementation details


PART 4 - TESTING THE BACKEND -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
npm test // Custom script to test your code (don't need to include "run" as in "npm run test" for this custom script)
		//Custom script is: "test": "node --test" //NOTE: script is updated on Part4b, see code below
		// must have a file named <file_name>.test.js ready (placed inside of a "tests" directory) before you execute command
		// node:test testing library automatically executes test files that end with .test.js 

npm install lodash // The Lodash library is a popular JavaScript utility library that provides a wide range of helpful functions for working with 		arrays, objects, strings, numbers, and more. It simplifies common programming tasks such as:
			// Deep cloning and merging objects
			// Manipulating and searching arrays (e.g., map, filter, find, groupBy, uniq)
			// Debouncing and throttling functions
			// Working with collections and iterables
			// Generating random values
			// String manipulation (e.g., camelCase, kebabCase)
			// Checking data types and values
//on Part4b, changed the scripts on package.json to:
	"start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production node index.js",
    	"dev": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development node --watch index.js",
    	"test": "cross-env  NODE_ENV=test node --test",

npm install cross-env // this is so the custom scripts we have define above work on Windows computers

npm install --save-dev supertest // enables easy and automated testing of Node.js HTTP servers 
	// It allows you to write tests that make HTTP requests to your server endpoints directly in your test files.
	// It is commonly used with test runners (like Jest, Mocha, or Node’s built-in test module) to verify that your API behaves as expected.

npm test -- tests/<file-name>.test.js // this runs the tests in the specified file
npm test -- --test-only // this only runs the "test.only" functions in your test files (**COMMAND NOT WORKING AS INTENDED FOR SOME REASON**)
npm test -- --test-name-pattern="a specific note is within the returned notes" // used for running tests with a specific name or describe block
	// it can also contain just a part of the name	
	// (**COMMAND NOT WORKING AS INTENDED FOR SOME REASON**)

//DON'T USE THE COMMAND BELOW
npm install express-async-errors // removes the need for having catch statements when working with async methods
	// THE COMMAND ABOVE ONLY WORKS WITH EXPRESS VERSION 4.X. YOU ARE CURRENTLY RUNNING EXPRESS VERSION 5.X
	// You do NOT need express-async-errors because Express 5 has native support for async/await error handling.
	// if you're using Express 5.x, you can safely remove explicit try/catch blocks in your async route handlers, as long as you have a proper 		error-handling middleware in place.

npm install bcrypt // used to generate password hashes (aka encrypting) before saving passwords to the database
npm install bcryptjs // ONLY USE THIS COMMAND IF bcrypt IS GIVING YOU PROBLEMS ON A WINDOWS COMPUTER
	// you can uninstall bcrypt with the command: npm uninstall bcrypt

npm install jsonwebtoken //used to implement user login functionality
	// If the application has multiple interfaces requiring identification, JWT's validation should be separated into its own middleware. An 		existing library like express-jwt could also be used.
