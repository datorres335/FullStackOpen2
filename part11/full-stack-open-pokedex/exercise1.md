In a hypothetical situation where I’m building an application with a team of 6 people using Python, we could use Pylint for linting as it'll help with line length and variable names. Flake8 could also be used as a style checker. For testing we could use pytest or unittest for unit and integration tests, and tox to test automation across multiple environments. For building we can use Poetry as a packaging manager and PyInstaller for packaging apps into standalone binaries.

Some cloud based CI alternatives to GitHub Actions are CircleCi, GitLab CI, Travis CI, BitBucket Pipelines, Azure Pipelines, and Buddy. And some self hosted CI alternatives to Jenkins are Buildkite, TeamCity, Drone CI, Woodpecker, and GoCD.

This setup would be better in a cloud-based environment since we’re working in a relatively small team. Cloud based CI systems are generally quicker to set up than self hosted CI systems and there’s no infrastructure to manage. And even though cloud based CI systems are only free to use to a certain point (depending on the frequency that we use the service), it is pretty cheap to use if we are working in a small team. We only need to start worrying about the cost of the cloud based CI services until we start expanding the development team.
